    Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
The scenario that was given was to help build a program that Airgead Banking would let schools use to teach students fiscal
responsibility. The focus of the project was for investing and power of compound interest. The requirements that were given 
required C++ code to be written to take input from the user and to help show the investments and interest after a certain 
period of time. 
    
    What did you do particularly well?
The code was written in a collection with object-oriented programming principles in mind. I feel the connection between the
classes worked well and the code was sufficient in being able to relay information. The pseudocode, input validation, and user
interface were well built to help guide the building of the code. 
    
    Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I could have written more comments within the code, giving a more clear idea of what each aspect within the code was for. The 
charts and balance that were produced needed a bit more structure as the output was not in the correct format when printed. 
    
    Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or 
    resources are you adding to your support network?
I found making sure that the code between the classes was correct and was properly able to pull infromation needed was the most
challenging as once you start developing further into the code it's hard to keep track of the inputs and outputs. We were provided 
with an instant feedback tool that was helpful in the overall development of the code that gave feedback as code was written and
submitted to give you better ideas on how to improve it. 
    
    What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
The skills that are transferable to other projects and course work is the use of object-oriented programming to help develop code. 
With the object-oriented programming, it is transferable between all different styles of coding programs. Knowing how the particular
code works and being able to create classes to help keep the code clean and efficient is a best practice. 
    
    How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
The code is easily accessible and within that the comments help to narrow down the sections. I feel that with further comments added
the readability of the code would be imporoved. The code is adaptable in the fact that if other information is needed, addition to the
code is permitted to allow for pulling new or even updated types of information from the inputs.
